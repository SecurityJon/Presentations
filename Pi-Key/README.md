# PiKey

I am the co-creator of PiKey, a Physical Penetration Testing device used for the extraction and reuse of credentials on locked Microsoft Windows systems. It is designed to work against corporate domain-joined machines, but may also work against home machines.

PiKey was presented at the BSidesLondon 2017 security conference on June 2017

Information and code for the PiKey can be found on the GitHub page
