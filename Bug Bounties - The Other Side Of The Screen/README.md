# Bug Bounties: The other side of the screen

## Abstract
Bug Bounties continue to grow and show no sign of slowing down. Multiple Bug Bounty programmes offer bug hunters the chance of becoming millionaires and with the anonymous nature of the system, age and geographic location are no longer obstacles for hunters wanting to make a name for themselves. 

However it’s not all sunshine and roses. With fierce competition from a growing number of bug hunters who are all competing for the same pool of vulnerabilities, and companies under increased pressure to optimise the value from their vulnerability disclosure programmes, conflicts of opinion about how bugs should be treated occur which leads to frustration on both sides of the screen.  

Over the years the information on how to get started on bug bounties, how to find your first bug and how to make your millions has grown exponentially, but there appears to be a lack of understanding of what happens after the bug gets submitted, how decisions around how much a bug is worth are made, and why so many bugs are closed as duplicates.

This talk aims to help explain some of the decisions around the most common frustrations echoed by bug hunters, build a better relationship between companies and bug hunters, and finally explains how you as a bug hunter can make even more money.

## Presentation Outline
* Introduction
  * Quick background around myself and the usual disclaimers. 
* Why run a Bug Bounty?
  * As the number of bug hunters increases, the average age drops. A growing number of bug hunters appear to have never worked in security for a large organisation and seem to have a lack of understanding of why companies run bug bounty programmes in the first place. This section sets the stage for the rest of the talk and helps bridge the knowledge gap around budgets and value.
* What happens after you submit a bug?
  * This section covers the steps that occur after a bug is submitted that they might not be aware of (such as the difficulty of tracking down the owner of an unknown asset which  has been set up by shadow IT and has now left the company) and the decision making process behind how much a bug is worth (especially exotic bugs that don’t fall into the usual buckets).
* Frustrations for Researchers
  * This section makes up the majority of the talk. It attempts to explain the most commonly seen frustrations coming from the bug hunter community, from a large company perspective. This includes:
    * Why ‘informational’ rated bugs are suddenly fixed after submission
    *	Why bugs are rated ‘duplicate’ even though there isn’t a duplicate bug
    *	Why multiple critical issues in an asset does not mean multiple pay outs
    *	Why vulnerabilities are sometimes downgraded in severity
    *	Why sometimes bugs take a long time to close

* Frustrations for Companies
  * This section attempts to explain two frustrations that occur on the company-side of bug hunting and how to avoid them
  * How overstepping bounds can result in major issues for a company
  * Why chasing for updates doesn’t help resolve bugs any quicker


* How to Maximize Your Profits
  * This section covers two ways in which bug hunters can make more money when submitting bugs. 
    * The first explains that a number of bugs do not fall directly into one criticality level or another, and instead sit on a fence between the two. It explains that the decision around the amount to pay out is down to the company, and by building a rapport (by avoiding the pitfalls previously presented) hunters are more likely to get a higher pay out.
    * The second proposes a new technique to avoid duplicate bug submissions, by explaining the bug triage process with timelines and showing  hunters they can get in quickly but still show impact before a bug is processed and paid.

## Audience take-aways

* A greater understanding of why companies run bug bounty programmes, and decisions around scope, bounty pay outs and processes
* An understanding (although maybe not an agreement) of how decisions are made when bugs are submitted, specifically for the bugs which are commonly echoed on social media as causing frustration
* An understanding of the frustrations companies are caused by bug hunters, and how to avoid them
* An understanding of how to make more money from bug hunting when dealing with companies.
